# Raj Lang
Another basic programming language, targeting the following features.

- Basic signed/unsigned integer and float types
- Arrays
- Maps/dictionaries
- Anonymous functions
- Clear type definitions for everything

Compile and run with:
```bash
./compile.sh
```

Or use the executable on a target file.

## Testing
Using *Catch* because it's header only.

```bash
git clone this
cd this/include/
git clone https://github.com/log4cplus/Catch
git clone https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11
```
